# Siddhartha Chaturvedi — Static Portfolio

This repository now hosts a static HTML/CSS/JS version of the portfolio. The React/Vite/NPM build artifacts have been removed in favor of a simple, zero-dependency site.

Files in this repository:
- `index.html` — main HTML file
- `styles.css` — global styling
- `script.js` — JavaScript for interactions (theme toggle, mobile nav, scroll spy, venture previews)
- `README.md` — this file

How to view locally:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser directly, or
2. Serve with a simple HTTP server (recommended):

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Notes:
- The site was rebuilt from the original React components and styles into plain HTML/CSS/JS.
- External resources (logos and screenshots) are fetched over the network; placeholder images or external URLs are used when the original `public/` assets were removed.
- If you'd like to keep the original profile image and resume in the repo, add them to the root folder and update `index.html` accordingly.

If you want the original React project preserved, it was removed in this cleanup — let me know if you'd like me to restore a separate branch with the React/Vite code before removing it.
